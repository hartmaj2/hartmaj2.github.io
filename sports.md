# Sports

To move is a pleasure. We have been given a beautiful machine called the body. It can do many cool things. It would be a shame to not use it.

## Climbing

In my previous life, I must have been born a monkey. I love the feeling of being in the height, reaching places not many dare to reach. The adrenaline rush when holds get bad. But most of all, the lessons that climbing teaches me that I can take to my daily life. The importance of balance, clear mind, constructive focus and belief.

## Swimming

Elegance and meditation combined.
