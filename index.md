Out of all places in the universe, you arrived at my webpage. Enjoy this unique moment that less than 0.0001% people have the honor to experience. 

## What can you find here?

A collection of thoughts that I find useful or interesting. Some of them will be written in English, some of them in Czech. So far I have divided these thought into these sections:
1. General - simply about life 
2. Mathematics - about my most belowed subject
3. Sports - mostly thoughts considering climbing or swimming technique or philosophy
4. Virtues - list of character traits that I find good
