# My 4th Game Jam

After less than five months, my friends and I have participated on another Game Jam, where we had to develop a computer game in less than 47 hours. The topic of the Game Jam was "Hero to Zero" and we took that in a very mathematical sense. You can see the resulting game [here](https://matouseek.itch.io/ad-nullum).

## Things that worked well

- writing a todo list inside a markdown, add a letter of the person that is responsible for the task written
  - for S (our arts expert) write a list of pictures that need to be drawn

- really question ourselves if the thing we're currently doing is important and don't waste stuff with cosmetic improvements of the game, sometimes they might not even be used
  - instead mark these cool ideas into the todo list and then when all important stuff is done, one can start working on these
  - e.g. we spend a lot of time making the locations on the map show if they have been completed or not by a specific color in a very automatized way but we have never used that, spent some time on custom cursor that we haven't included as well

- use the Godot picture for testing the skeleton of how the program will work while we don't have the finished pictures from S
  - add different colors of the Godot figure
  - maybe prepare these dummy props in advance

## Things to improve

As it usually is, I have been thinking quite a lot about what we could improve till the next Game Jam.
