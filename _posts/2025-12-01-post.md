# My 5th Game Jam

Another time passed, 5th game jam was here again and our game [there](https://vladikxyz.itch.io/rotr5).

## Things that worked well

- debugging options to test game endings

- todo list in markdown
  - maybe don't need a whole Notes folder, just place the todo.md in root folder

- using chatgpt for
  - tileset generation
  - npc room and slots assignment code (was faster than if I did it manually)

- use Ctrl + F to find parts of code, files and everything in the godot editor (don't browse, it wastes time)

- use VS Code for git (faster than typing)
  - maybe add an extension so I have autocomplete and not have to type so much

- have an external monitor so I can use two displays

- always analyze what is the most important part of the game and focus only on that

## Things to improve

- DON'T USE DIR ACCESS (it breaks the web build)
  - instead hard code the paths to the assets into an array

- ask other people for opinion on the game even more

- learn how to create a state automaton for npc's

- measurable game goals in game ending

- don't edit same scene by two people at same time (we wasted almost an hour fixing merge confict and had to create develop2)
  - editing just the code of same scene is fine but not the .tscn file

- learn how to use inheritance in Godot 
  - we used it for npc vs woman and it was not quite ideal
  - I also did not realize I can access variables of the superclass (npc) from within the subclass (woman) right away and created special functions to access them which was completely unnecessary

- play_audio function could be in GM to be used globally instead of copying it everywhere
