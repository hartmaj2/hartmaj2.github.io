# Useful mental models

Yesterday evening, we had a family reunion after a long time of not being all together. As it happens, our conversation gradually became more and more philosophical and at one point, we gave my brother a fun physics riddle with the following setting:

> A car travels from point A to point B with speed 50 km/h. How fast does it have to travel back to achieve an average speed 100 km/h for the whole trip.

He was thinking a long time about it and tried to solve it on paper. He was resilient but after a while, he asked for help. He almost gotting and with just a little hint, he solved it. Then dad showed us a really nice visual explanation of why the result is so with two riders. It goes as follows:

> One goes with speed 100 km/h and one with 50 km/h. You can imagine, that you want to arrive at the end at the same time as the second rider. But where does the second rider end up, where we are at point B? He is already back to point A, so we would have to teleport in order to get to the same average speed as him.

This nice explanation lead to the main topic of the conversation: **Can one learn how to come up with such ideas or is it just intelligence?**

My brother ask the question and he said he calls these helpful ways of thinking *mental models*.
