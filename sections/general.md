# General 

Thoughts or concepts I consider useful for living a good life. What does good mean? I will not define that here, sorry. You know what I mean.

## Balance 

Lots of things in life revolve around not going too much into one direction or another. Having no sleep is certainly bad, but sleeping all day is of no use as well. Doing sports is great and healthy, but spending 10 hours a day running is not the way as well. If things in life were so simple, that being good just meant choosing a thing and spending 100% of time with it, why would so many people struggle?

The hard and luckily also beautiful part of life is getting as close as possible to the right amount of balance in different areas of life. Why hard? Because where do you find out what the right amount is? How do you measure balance? By time, energy or whatever? It is quite interesting to think about this. Have fun thinking!
