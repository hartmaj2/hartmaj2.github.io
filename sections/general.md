# General 

Thoughts or concepts I consider useful for living a good life. What does good mean? I will not define that here, sorry. You know what I mean.

## Balance 

Lots of things in life revolve around not going too much into one direction or another. Having no sleep is certainly bad, but sleeping all day is of no use as well. Doing sports is great and healthy, but spending 10 hours a day running is not the way as well. If things in life were so simple, that being good just meant choosing a thing and spending 100% of time with it, why would so many people struggle?

The hard and luckily also beautiful part of life is getting as close as possible to the right amount of balance in different areas of life. Why hard? Because where do you find out what the right amount is? How do you measure balance? By time, energy or whatever? It is quite interesting to think about this. Have fun thinking!

Some interesting areas in life when I find striking the right amount of balance particularly interesting:
- planning vs executing
  - university work
  - life in general
- exploring vs exploiting
  - taking risks by trying new things
  - sticking to daily habits
- consuming vs creating
  - creating something useful
  - getting the necessary materials to create from
  - subarea: listening (observe-like activity) vs talking (create-like activity)
  - subarea: observing vs acting
- getting it done somehow vs aiming for perfection
- letting things go vs taking action
  - avoiding meaningless conflicts
  - not being afraid to speak up when necessary

## Flow of resources

I used to really like to own things. I thought the goal is to get as much property and money so that you don't have to work anymore. Spending money should be limited as much as possible.

Lately I turned this way of thinking around. I think money should flow instead of being hoarded on one place. I should be able to generate the money by working hard and good, but I should not be sticking to it but inside spending it so it helps somebody else as well. Spending money is a way of giving back to the society. It is a way of taking part in it and rewarding the things that we find useful and good.

Also, like The Little Prince said, we should be of use to things that we own. We should be able to take care of these things. If we own more stuff than what we can handle, we should not own that stuff and rather sell it.
