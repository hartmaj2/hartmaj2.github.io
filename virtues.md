# Virtues

This idea was born in my head when I was reading the book [Labyrint světa a ráj srdce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labyrinth_of_the_World_and_Paradise_of_the_Heart) by Jan Amos Komenský. I realized, that to be a good person, one should have strong values by which one can operate in daily life. Without values, we are like a tornado. What can others expect from us? Will we be able to create something beautiful or will our lives be full of chaos? Virtues nurture order and order nurtures creation.

Yeah and I was also inspired by the cool statues of virtues in [Kuks](https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braunovy_sochy_Ctnost%C3%AD_a_Ne%C5%99est%C3%AD_v_Kuksu).

So here I would like to list virtues that I find good but maybe also unconventional and interesting.
